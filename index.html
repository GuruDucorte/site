    <h1>Midjourney</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Midjourney is an independent research lab that produces an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> program under the same name that creates images from textual descriptions, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">OpenAI's</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> and Stable Diffusion. It is speculated that the underlying technology is based on Stable Diffusion. The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022.[4] The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion.[5] Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable. Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands</p>
    <p>Midjourney was founded by David Holz, co-founder of Leap Motion. It first entered open beta on July 12, 2022.[4] However, on March 14, 2022, the discord server launched with a request to post high-quality photographs to Twitter/Reddit for system's training.The company has been working on improving its algorithms, releasing new versions every few months. Version 2 of their algorithm was launched in April 2022 [8] and version 3 in July.[9] On November 10, 2022, the alpha iteration of version 4 was released to users.[10]</p>
    <h3>Functionality</h3> 
    <p>Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To generate images, users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.</p>
